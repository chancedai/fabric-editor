# Fabric Design Editor

**Fabric Design Editor** is an open-source personal project inspired by popular online design tools like Canva, Crello, and PosterMyWall.  
Originally built with **Fabric.js** and Vanilla JavaScript, it has been refactored using **Vite** and **Tailwind CSS** for easier learning and experimentation.

> ⚠️ This project has never been officially launched and is intended for learning and technical reference only.  
> ⚠️ APIs for images, backgrounds, and other Unsplash-based resources are not included — you need to implement or remove them yourself.
